				<h2 class="uk-text-bold">Background</h2>
				<p>For my first semester at Georgia Tech in Fall 2020, I was actually an electrical engineering major. In that first semester, I took a class called ECE Discovery Studio (ECE 1871, now ECE 1100), in which the final project was to do a self-guided "discovery project" of some kind.</p>
				<p>I chose to make a four-function calculator for my discovery project, using the Arduino microcontroller. This project actually went for much longer than the end of that class; I continued during the Winter 2020 semester break, and finished in Summer 2021.</p>

				<h2 class="uk-text-bold">Hardware Design</h2>
				<p>The hardware has a pretty straightforward structure of input (the buttons for the calculator), processor (Arduino), and output (the LCD display).</p>
				<img src="./images/calc-hardware.png" width="600" class="uk-align-center"/>
				<p>A normal four-function calculator has 24 buttons, which would require 24 input/output slots. However, the Arduino UNO microcontroller I used only had 14 input/output slots.</p>
				<p>And thus, in between the buttons and the Arduino are three parallel-to-serial shift registers that can condense the 24 button inputs to take up only 3 slots on the Arduino. This is done by sending all 24 input values sequentially through one output, with the other two slots used for clock and latch signals.</p>
				<p>Using the shift registers also has the advantage of freeing up slots for the LCD display.  I used a display compatible with the Hitachi HD44780 driver, which allowed me to use the Arduino LiquidCrystal library, simplifying programming.</p>
				<h2 class="uk-text-bold">Software</h2>
				<p>The software on the calculator interprets the inputs, performs calculations if necessary, and outputs values to the LCD display.</p>
				<p>Early on in development, I found that the numerical data types in Arduino were too inaccurate to use for the calculator, and so I created my own library for entering and performing calculations on numbers. This library would hold numbers as arrays of place values, and so I had to program in operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and taking square roots myself.</p>
